# Firebase Setup for Community Features

## Overview
This document outlines the Firebase Firestore setup required for the community page's likes and comments functionality.

## Firestore Collections

### 1. `likes` Collection
Stores user likes for posts.

**Document Structure:**
```json
{
  "userId": "string",      // Firebase Auth UID
  "postId": "string",      // Post identifier
  "createdAt": "timestamp" // Server timestamp
}
```

**Collection Rules:**
- Users can only create/delete their own likes
- No duplicate likes per user per post
- Automatic cleanup when post is deleted

### 2. `comments` Collection
Stores user comments on posts.

**Document Structure:**
```json
{
  "postId": "string",      // Post identifier
  "author": {
    "uid": "string",       // Firebase Auth UID
    "name": "string",      // Display name
    "email": "string",     // User email
    "avatar": "string"     // Optional avatar URL
  },
  "text": "string",        // Comment content
  "createdAt": "timestamp" // Server timestamp
}
```

**Collection Rules:**
- Users can only create comments
- Users can only edit/delete their own comments
- Comments are automatically deleted when post is deleted

## Security Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Likes collection
    match /likes/{likeId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Comments collection
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.author.uid;
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.author.uid;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.author.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
